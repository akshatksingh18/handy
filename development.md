# Development guide

How the code is organised and how to work on it. Adapted from the
development notes of Handy, the app this project started from; the workspace
`CLAUDE.md` chain still controls agent behaviour. Heavy builds and full test
suites run on GitHub Actions, not locally (see `windows-local-setup.md`).

## Development Commands

**Prerequisites:**

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager

**Core Development:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run in development mode
bun run tauri dev
# If cmake error on macOS:
CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 bun run tauri dev

# Build for production
bun run tauri build

# Frontend only development
bun run dev        # Start Vite dev server
bun run build      # Build frontend (TypeScript + Vite)
bun run preview    # Preview built frontend
```

**Linting and Formatting (run before committing):**

```bash
bun run lint              # ESLint for frontend
bun run lint:fix          # ESLint with auto-fix
bun run format            # Prettier + cargo fmt
bun run format:check      # Check formatting without changes
bun run format:frontend   # Prettier only
bun run format:backend    # cargo fmt only
```

**Model Setup (Required for Development):**

```bash
mkdir -p src-tauri/resources/models
curl -L -o src-tauri/resources/models/silero-vad-v6.2-F32.gguf https://huggingface.co/handy-computer/silero-vad-v6.2-gguf/resolve/main/silero-vad-v6.2-F32.gguf
```

For detailed platform-specific build setup, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture Overview

Voice Workspace is a cross-platform desktop speech-to-text application built with Tauri 2.x (Rust backend + React/TypeScript frontend).

### Backend Structure (src-tauri/src/)

- `lib.rs` - Main entry point, Tauri setup, manager initialization
- `engine_supervisor/` - Runs transcribe.cpp in a supervised child process (the exe relaunched with `--transcribe-worker`)
- `managers/` - Core business logic:
  - `audio.rs` - Audio recording and device management
  - `model.rs` - Model downloading and management
  - `transcription.rs` - Speech-to-text pipeline; `transcription/` holds the live decoders (stream, long-form chunks, early phrases) and `policy.rs`, which picks between them
  - `history.rs` - Transcription history storage
- `audio_toolkit/` - Low-level audio processing:
  - `audio/` - Recording sink (VAD, levels, live streaming feed), output devices, WAV I/O
  - `vad/` - Voice Activity Detection (Silero VAD)
- `commands/` - Tauri command handlers for frontend communication
- `cli.rs` - CLI argument definitions (clap derive)
- `shortcut.rs` - Global keyboard shortcut handling
- `settings.rs` - Application settings management
- `overlay.rs` - Recording overlay window (platform-specific)
- `signal_handle.rs` - `send_transcription_input()` reusable function
- `utils.rs` - Platform detection helpers

### Frontend Structure (src/)

- `App.tsx` - Main component with onboarding flow
- `components/` - React UI components:
  - `settings/` - Settings UI
  - `model-selector/` - Model management interface
  - `onboarding/` - First-run experience
  - `overlay/` - Recording overlay UI
  - `shared/`, `ui/`, `icons/`, `footer/` - Shared components
- `hooks/useSettings.ts` - Settings state management hook
- `stores/settingsStore.ts` - Zustand store for settings
- `bindings.ts` - Auto-generated Tauri type bindings (via tauri-specta)
- `overlay/` - Recording overlay window entry point
- `lib/types.ts` - Shared TypeScript type definitions

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Manager Pattern:** Core functionality organized into managers (Audio, Model, Transcription) initialized at startup and managed via Tauri state.

**Command-Event Architecture:** Frontend → Backend via Tauri commands; Backend → Frontend via events.

**Pipeline Processing:** Audio → VAD → Whisper/Parakeet → Text output → Clipboard/Paste

**State Flow:** Zustand → Tauri Command → Rust State → Persistence (tauri-plugin-store)

### Technology Stack

**Core Libraries:**

- `transcribe-cpp` - Local speech recognition (Whisper, Parakeet, Moonshine, SenseVoice, etc.; GGML/GGUF) with GPU acceleration
- `handy-recorder` - Microphone capture: device selection, resampling to 16 kHz, failure detection
- `transcribe-cpp` (Silero VAD v6, CPU-only, in-process) / `earshot` - Voice Activity Detection
- `rdev` - Global keyboard shortcuts
- `rodio` - Audio playback for feedback sounds

### Application Flow

1. **Initialization:** App starts minimized to tray, loads settings, initializes managers
2. **Model Setup:** First run downloads the chosen model from Hugging Face
3. **Recording:** Global shortcut triggers audio recording with VAD filtering
4. **Processing:** Audio sent to Whisper model for transcription
5. **Output:** Text pasted to active application via system clipboard

### Settings System

Settings are stored using Tauri's store plugin with reactive updates:

- Keyboard shortcuts (configurable, supports push-to-talk)
- Audio devices (microphone/output selection)
- Model choice and recognition mode (streaming, full recording, early phrases)
- Audio feedback and translation options

### Single Instance Architecture

The app enforces single instance behavior — launching when already running brings the settings window to front rather than creating a new process. Remote control flags (`--toggle-transcription`, etc.) work by launching a second instance that sends args to the running instance via `tauri_plugin_single_instance`, then exits.

## User-facing text

The interface ships in English only, but every user-facing string still goes
through i18next (`src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`), and ESLint rejects
hard-coded text in JSX. The tray menu strings are generated from the same file
by `src-tauri/build.rs`.

**Adding new text:**

1. Add key to `src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`
2. Use in component: `const { t } = useTranslation(); t('key.path')`

## Code Style

**Rust:**

- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing
- Handle errors explicitly (avoid unwrap in production)
- Use descriptive names, add doc comments for public APIs

**TypeScript/React:**

- Strict TypeScript, avoid `any` types
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Path aliases: `@/` → `./src/`

## CLI Parameters

Voice Workspace supports command-line parameters on all platforms for integration with scripts, window managers, and autostart configurations.

**Implementation:** `cli.rs` (definitions), `main.rs` (parsing), `lib.rs` (applying), `signal_handle.rs` (shared logic)

| Flag                     | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--toggle-transcription` | Toggle recording on/off on a running instance              |
| `--toggle-post-process`  | Toggle recording with post-processing on/off               |
| `--cancel`               | Cancel the current operation on a running instance         |
| `--start-hidden`         | Launch without showing the main window (tray icon visible) |
| `--no-tray`              | Launch without system tray (closing window quits the app)  |
| `--debug`                | Enable debug mode with verbose (Trace) logging             |

**Key design decisions:**

- CLI flags are runtime-only overrides — they do NOT modify persisted settings
- Remote control flags work via `tauri_plugin_single_instance`: second instance sends args, then exits
- `send_transcription_input()` in `signal_handle.rs` is shared between signal handlers and CLI

## Debug Mode

Access debug features: `Cmd+Shift+D` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+D` (Windows/Linux)

## Platform Notes

- **macOS**: Metal acceleration, accessibility permissions required for keyboard shortcuts
- **Windows**: Vulkan acceleration on x64 (the ARM64 build is CPU-only). Implicit Vulkan layers (overlays, capture hooks) are disabled for the Voice Workspace process via `VK_LOADER_LAYERS_DISABLE=~implicit~` set in `main.rs`; opt out with `HANDY_KEEP_VULKAN_IMPLICIT_LAYERS=1` or by setting `VK_LOADER_LAYERS_DISABLE` yourself
- **Linux**: OpenBLAS + Vulkan, limited Wayland support, overlay uses GTK layer shell (disable with `HANDY_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL=1`)

## Troubleshooting

See [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Libraries still maintained by Handy's authors

These are ordinary versioned dependencies, not a link to Handy's app code.
Nothing updates them automatically; change a pin only on purpose.

- `transcribe-cpp` (crates.io) and the `handy-computer/*` Hugging Face model
  repositories: the speech engine and the GGUF model files.
- `handy-recorder` (crates.io): microphone capture.
- Git pins in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: `cjpais/hf-hub` (cancellable
  downloads) and a `cjpais/tao` patch for a tray fix not yet released in tao.
- The model catalog code in `src/lib/model-catalog/` is vendored (copied in)
  from `@handy-computer/models` 0.2.2 and now edited here.
